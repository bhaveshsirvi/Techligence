1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Getting started
### Steps  
1.Clone the Repository: This will download a copy of the code onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/bhaveshsirvi/Techligence.git

#Navigate to the directory
cd Techligence
```
2. Install dependencies and run a local development server   
```
#Install all the dependencies mentioned in the 'package.json' file
npm install

#Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Contributing
### Getting Started with Git
After installing Git, open your terminal ("Git Bash" for Windows or the terminal for Linux and macOS). Configure Git by executing the following commands:
```
# Set your global username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your global email
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

# Add the remote directory to your local repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/bhaveshsirvi/Techligence.git

# Fetch updates from the main repository
# (Note: Make sure you are on the main branch before updating)
git fetch origin

```
You're now all set to contribute to the project!
### Creating a New Feature Branch

Start by creating a new branch following the naming convention feature/<feature-name>. ```git checkout {branchname}``` allows to switch between branches.
```
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

# Stage all modified files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"

# Push your changes to the remote repository
git push origin feature/<feature-name>
```

After this you will be prompted for an username and password of your github account. 

### Authentication Issues

If you have any errors while proceeding perform the following steps : 
1  Log in to your GitHub account.
2  Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select "Settings."
3  In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings."
4  In the left sidebar again, click on "Personal access tokens." and select "Tokens(Classic)"
5  Click on "Generate new token."
6  Enter a descriptive name for your token in the "Note" field.
7  Under "Scopes," select the permissions your token needs. For general Git operations, "repo," "read:org," "write:org," are generally sufficient.
8  Scroll down and click "Generate token."
9  Copy the generated token and keep it secure. You won't be able to see it again.
10 Now after executing the git push command enter your username as usual and then enter your token as your password.

You are nearly done.

### Creating a Pull Request

Follow the steps and write a short description about your feature this will count as your final submission.

You are all done. Now relax â˜• and wait for your next task or feedback in case there are some bugs with your work.
